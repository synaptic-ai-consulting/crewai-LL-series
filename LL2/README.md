# Lightning Lesson 2: Advanced Agent Persona Architecture

## Overview
This demo showcases the power of CrewAI's advanced agent persona architecture, demonstrating how custom prompt templates can transform generic AI agents into branded, enterprise-ready solutions.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- **Default vs Persona-Engineered Agents**: Before/after comparison showing dramatic quality differences
- **Custom Prompt Templates**: Using `prompt_file` attribute for consistent agent behavior
- **Enterprise Persona Types**: Legal, Marketing, and Technical personas with distinct characteristics
- **Context Adaptation**: How personas maintain consistency while adapting to different scenarios

└── run_demo.py                       # Main demo runner script
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 2. Run Demo
```bash
# Run full demo (comparison + showcase)
python run_demo.py

# Run before/after comparison only
python run_demo.py --comparison

# Run persona showcase only
python run_demo.py --showcase

# Run with specific task from config
python run_demo.py --task "product_launch_email"

# Run specific crew
python run_demo.py --crew "creative_marketing_crew"

# List available configurations
python run_demo.py --list-configs

# Validate YAML configurations
python run_demo.py --validate
```

## Demo Components

### 1. Before/After Comparison
- **Default Agent**: Generic, robotic responses using CrewAI's default prompts
- **Persona Agent**: Brand-aligned, professional responses using custom prompts
- **Key Insight**: Dramatic quality difference in professional output

### 2. Persona Engineering Stack
```
├── Core Identity (brand voice, expertise level)
├── Context Adaptation (formal/casual, technical/business)
├── Collaboration Patterns (how agents work together)
└── Error Recovery (staying in character under pressure)
```

### 3. Enterprise Persona Types

#### Legal Compliance Agent
- **Characteristics**: Conservative, thorough, cites sources
- **Use Cases**: Compliance reviews, risk assessment, regulatory guidance
- **Key Behaviors**: Always cites regulations, asks probing questions, provides disclaimers

#### Creative Marketing Agent
- **Characteristics**: Bold, trend-aware, brand-aligned
- **Use Cases**: Campaign strategy, content creation, brand positioning
- **Key Behaviors**: Uses action-oriented language, focuses on emotional connection, references trends

#### Technical Lead Agent
- **Characteristics**: Precise, security-focused, solution-oriented
- **Use Cases**: Architecture design, security reviews, technical planning
- **Key Behaviors**: Considers security implications, provides detailed specifications, focuses on scalability

## Sample Tasks

### Marketing Tasks
- "Write a product launch email for our new AI tool"
- "Create a viral marketing campaign for our mobile app"
- "Design a brand positioning strategy for our B2B SaaS product"

### Legal Tasks
- "Review our data privacy policy for compliance issues"
- "Draft a data processing agreement for our EU customers"
- "Assess the legal implications of our new AI feature"

### Technical Tasks
- "Design a microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform"
- "Architect a real-time chat system for our platform"
- "Create a disaster recovery plan for our cloud infrastructure"

## Key Learning Outcomes

### Immediate Takeaways
- Understanding of `prompt_file` attribute in CrewAI
- Framework for persona engineering
- Recognition of brand consistency importance
- Practical implementation steps

### Screenshot-Worthy Moments
- Before/after agent response comparison
- Persona Engineering Stack framework
- Enterprise persona examples
- Code implementation examples

## Implementation Details

### Custom Prompt Templates
Each persona uses a structured prompt template with:
- **Core Identity**: Professional stance, communication style, expertise level
- **Context Adaptation**: How to adjust for different scenarios
- **Collaboration Patterns**: How agents work with others
- **Error Recovery**: Maintaining character under pressure
- **Key Behaviors**: Specific phrases and response patterns

### Agent Class Structure
```python
# Default Agent (generic)
agent = Agent(
    role="Marketing Specialist",
    goal="Create compelling marketing content"
)

# Persona-Engineered Agent (branded)
agent = Agent(
    role="Marketing Specialist",
    goal="Create compelling marketing content",
    prompt_file="prompts/creative_marketing_agent.txt"
)
```

## Expected Demo Results

### Default Agent Response
- Generic, ChatGPT-like responses
- Lacks brand voice and professional differentiation
- No context adaptation or specialized knowledge
- Robotic, impersonal communication

### Persona-Engineered Response
- Brand-aligned, professional tone
- Context-aware adaptation
- Specialized expertise demonstration
- Consistent character across interactions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **API Key Not Set**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `.env` file
2. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed
3. **File Not Found**: Ensure prompt files are in the correct `prompts/` directory

### Debug Mode
Set `CREWAI_VERBOSE=True` in your `.env` file for detailed logging.

## Next Steps

1. **Experiment with Personas**: Modify prompt templates to create your own personas
2. **Test Different Tasks**: Try various scenarios to see persona adaptation
3. **Build Persona Library**: Create reusable templates for different use cases
4. **Integrate with Crews**: Use personas in multi-agent CrewAI systems
