## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management (`state.py`)

**Purpose**: Centralized state management using Pydantic models for type safety and validation.

**Key Classes**:
- `Lesson1State`: Main state container for all demo approaches
- `GuideOutline`: Structured output format for outline generation
- `ReviewResult`: Structured output format for review results

**Design Decisions**:
- Used Pydantic for runtime type checking and serialization
- Implemented JSON encoders for datetime objects
- Added performance metrics tracking at the state level
- Included error logging and audit trail capabilities

```python
class Lesson1State(BaseModel):
    # Input parameters
    topic: str = ""
    audience: str = ""
    
    # Content generation pipeline
    outline: Optional[str] = None
    draft: Optional[str] = None
    review_comments: Optional[str] = None
    risk_level: Optional[str] = None
    final_content: Optional[str] = None
    
    # Workflow control
    compliance_status: str = "pending"
    current_stage: str = "initialized"
    
    # Metadata and observability
    created_at: datetime = datetime.now()
    updated_at: datetime = datetime.now()
    error_log: Optional[str] = None
    performance_metrics: Dict[str, float] = {}
```

### 2. Crew-Only Implementation (`crew_only.py`)

- Composite task design showing potential for chaos
- Performance tracking across execution stages
- Error handling with graceful degradation

**Implementation Highlights**:
```python
class CrewOnlyDemo:
    def __init__(self, topic: str, audience: str):
        self.state = Lesson1State(topic=topic, audience=audience)
        self.performance_metrics: Dict[str, float] = {}
    
    def run_demo(self) -> Lesson1State:
        # Stage 1: Create agents
        self._create_agents()
        # Stage 2: Create composite task
        self._create_tasks()
        # Stage 3: Execute crew
        self._execute_crew()
        # Stage 4: Process results
        self._process_results()
        return self.state

        return self.state
    
    @router(compliance_review)
    def risk_assessment(self, state):
        # Conditional routing based on risk level
