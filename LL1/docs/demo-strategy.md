# Lightning Lesson 1 Demo Strategy: Flows vs Crews

## Executive Summary

This demo strategy demonstrates the strategic decision-making framework between CrewAI Flows and Crews through a live, side-by-side comparison. The goal is to show when structure beats autonomy in enterprise AI applications, using a content generation workflow with compliance review as the use case.

## Demo Architecture Overview

### Core Problem Statement
Generate a technical guide section with mandatory compliance review, demonstrating three approaches:
1. **Crew-only**: Autonomous agents with minimal structure
2. **Flow-only**: Structured workflow with direct LLM calls
3. **Hybrid**: Flow orchestration with targeted Crew collaboration

### State Management Strategy
```python
class Lesson1State(BaseModel):
    topic: str = ""
    audience: str = ""
    outline: Optional[str] = None
    draft: Optional[str] = None
    review_comments: Optional[str] = None
    risk_level: Optional[str] = None
    final_content: Optional[str] = None
    compliance_status: str = "pending"
```

## Demo Flow Structure

### Stage A: Crew-Only Baseline (2 minutes)
**Objective**: Show autonomous agents creating unpredictable outcomes

**Implementation**:
```python
# Autonomous crew with open-ended task
writer = Agent(
    role="Technical Writer",
    goal="Write comprehensive technical content",
    backstory="Expert technical writer with deep domain knowledge"
)

reviewer = Agent(
    role="Compliance Reviewer", 
    goal="Review content for compliance and quality",
    backstory="Strict compliance officer focused on risk mitigation"
)

# Single composite task - shows chaos potential
composite_task = Task(
    description="Write and review a technical guide section on API security",
    expected_output="Complete, compliant technical guide section",
    agent=writer
)
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Variable output quality
- Unpredictable handoff timing
- No structured state management
- Difficult to audit or debug

### Stage B: Flow-Only Structure (3 minutes)
**Objective**: Demonstrate precise control with direct LLM orchestration

**Implementation**:
```python
class FlowOnlyDemo(Flow[Lesson1State]):
    @start()
    def initialize_topic(self):
        self.state.topic = "API Gateway Security Best Practices"
        self.state.audience = "Enterprise Developers"
        return self.state

    @listen(initialize_topic)
    def create_outline(self, state):
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o", response_format=GuideOutline)
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Create outline for {state.topic}"}]
        self.state.outline = llm.call(messages=messages)
        return self.state

    @listen(create_outline)
    def draft_content(self, state):
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o")
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write section using outline: {state.outline}"}]
        self.state.draft = llm.call(messages=messages)
        return self.state

    @listen(draft_content)
    def compliance_review(self, state):
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o")
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Review for compliance: {state.draft}"}]
        self.state.review_comments = llm.call(messages=messages)
        self.state.risk_level = "low"  # Simplified for demo
        return self.state
```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Predictable execution path
- Clear state transitions
- Easy to debug and audit
- Limited creative collaboration

### Stage C: Hybrid Architecture (4 minutes)
**Objective**: Show optimal combination of structure and intelligence

**Implementation**:
```python
class HybridDemo(Flow[Lesson1State]):
    @start()
    def initialize_topic(self):
        self.state.topic = "API Gateway Security Best Practices"
        self.state.audience = "Enterprise Developers"
        return self.state

    @listen(initialize_topic)
    def create_outline(self, state):
        # Direct LLM for structured output
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o", response_format=GuideOutline)
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Create outline for {state.topic}"}]
        self.state.outline = llm.call(messages=messages)
        return self.state

    @listen(create_outline)
    def collaborative_draft_review(self, state):
        # Crew for complex collaboration
        from .mini_crew import run_writer_reviewer_crew
        
        draft, review, risk = run_writer_reviewer_crew(
            topic=state.topic,
            outline=state.outline,
            audience=state.audience
        )
        
        self.state.draft = draft
        self.state.review_comments = review
        self.state.risk_level = risk
        return self.state

    @router(collaborative_draft_review)
    def risk_assessment(self, state):
        return "high_risk" if state.risk_level == "high" else "approved"

    @listen(risk_assessment.route("high_risk"))
    def compliance_fix(self, state):
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o")
        messages = [{"role": "user", "content": f"Fix compliance issues: {state.review_comments}\nDraft: {state.draft}"}]
        self.state.final_content = llm.call(messages=messages)
        self.state.compliance_status = "approved"
        return self.state

    @listen(risk_assessment.route("approved"))
    def finalize_content(self, state):
        self.state.final_content = state.draft
        self.state.compliance_status = "approved"
        return self.state
```

**Mini Crew Implementation**:
```python
# mini_crew.py
def run_writer_reviewer_crew(topic: str, outline: str, audience: str):
    writer = Agent(
        role="Technical Writer",
        goal="Create comprehensive, accurate technical content",
        backstory="Senior technical writer specializing in enterprise security"
    )
    
    reviewer = Agent(
        role="Compliance Specialist",
        goal="Ensure content meets enterprise compliance standards",
        backstory="Experienced compliance officer with security expertise"
    )
    
    write_task = Task(
        description=f"Write technical section on {topic} for {audience} using outline: {outline}",
        expected_output="Complete technical section with clear explanations and examples",
        agent=writer
    )
    
    review_task = Task(
        description=f"Review technical content for compliance, accuracy, and enterprise readiness",
        expected_output="Detailed review with specific recommendations and risk assessment (low/medium/high)",
        agent=reviewer,
        context=[write_task]
    )
    
    crew = Crew(
        agents=[writer, reviewer],
        tasks=[write_task, review_task],
        process=Process.sequential,
        verbose=True
    )
    
    result = crew.kickoff()
    
    # Extract structured outputs
    draft = write_task.output.raw if write_task.output else ""
    review = review_task.output.raw if review_task.output else ""
    risk = "high" if "high" in review.lower() else ("medium" if "medium" in review.lower() else "low")
    
    return draft, review, risk
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
@listen(create_outline)
def create_outline_with_fallback(self, state):
    try:
        llm = LLM(model="gpt-4o", response_format=GuideOutline)
        self.state.outline = llm.call(messages=messages)
    except Exception as e:
        # Fallback to simple string output
        self.state.outline = f"Basic outline for {state.topic}"
        self.state.error_log = str(e)
    return self.state
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
import time
from typing import Dict

class PerformanceTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics: Dict[str, float] = {}
    
    def track_step(self, step_name: str, start_time: float):
        self.metrics[step_name] = time.time() - start_time
```

### State Persistence
```python
def save_state_snapshot(self, stage: str):
    snapshot = {
        "stage": stage,
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "state": self.state.dict(),
        "performance": self.performance_tracker.metrics
    }
    # Save to file or database for analysis
```

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Execution Time**: Hybrid should be 20-30% faster than crew-only
- **Consistency**: Flow and hybrid should show <5% output variance
- **Error Rate**: Hybrid should have <1% failure rate
- **State Integrity**: 100% state preservation across transitions
